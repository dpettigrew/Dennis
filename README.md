## Contributions

The following critiera will be used to accept contributions:

* Does the contribution solve a problem?
* Does it correct an issue in the software?
* Was it contributed to the most relevant project?
* Does it adhere to this guide (as it exists at the time of the contribution)?
* Does the contribution contain unit or functional tests?
* Does it break existing code or mitigate that breakage somehow?
* ... more to follow
 
The above being said, we want to help you meet the criteria that we've set out if your contribution doesn't already.  We'll do that through PRs, issues, carrier pidgeons, etc.
